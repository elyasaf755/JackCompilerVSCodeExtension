### Usage:<br>
Open your Jack project using VSCode by clicking **File -> Open Folder...** and then selecting your Jack project's folder.<br>
After a few seconds of VSCode loading your project, you'll notice a small **Save & Compile** button at the bottom-left corner of the IDE:<br>

<br>
Clicking the **Save & Compile** button will save your entire project and will try to compile it. If the compiler encountered errors, it will pop-up error messages. Clicking each error message will redirect you to the problematic line of code in a specific file (problematic - by the compiler's prespective):

<br>
If compilation was succesful - the following message will pop-up:<br>
